<h1>Best movie according to Arianna</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movie of the year</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Mule</h3>
<p>One of the best movies I've seen this year, I really liked the main actor and the plot of the film.</p>
<h3>Slocum et moi</h3>
<p>It's a French animated film. I really appreciated the illustrations and the story, which conveys a strong moral. Very sweet and touching.</p>
<h3>Uncut Gems</h3>
<p>A very chaotic film with a unique directing style â€” not for everyone, but I definitely enjoyed it.</p>
